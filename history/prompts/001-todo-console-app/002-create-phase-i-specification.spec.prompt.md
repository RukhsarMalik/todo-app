## Prompt

I have created the constitution.md file for Phase I. Now I need to create a comprehensive specification file that defines WHAT we need to build.

Please create a `specs/phase1-specification.md` file that includes:

## 1. Project Overview
- Project Name: Todo Console App (Phase I)
- Phase: Phase I - In-Memory Python Console Application
- Technology Stack: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
- Development Approach: Spec-Driven Development (no manual coding)

## 2. User Personas
- Primary User: Developer learning Spec-Driven Development
- Use Case: Managing daily tasks via command-line interface
- Experience Level: Comfortable with terminal/CLI tools

## 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: Add New Task
**As a user, I want to add a new task so that I can track things I need to do.**

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can provide task title (required, 1-200 characters)
- User can provide task description (optional, max 1000 characters)
- System assigns unique ID to each task automatically
- Task is marked as "pending" by default
- System confirms task creation with success message
- Invalid inputs show clear error messages

### User Story 2: View All Tasks
**As a user, I want to see all my tasks so that I know what needs to be done.**

Acceptance Criteria:
- Display all tasks in a readable format
- Show task ID, title, status (pending/completed), and description
- Empty list shows friendly "No tasks found" message
- Tasks are displayed in order of creation (newest first OR oldest first)
- Status indicators are clear (e.g., [ ] pending, [笨転 completed)

### User Story 3: Update Task
**As a user, I want to update a task so that I can modify details as plans change.**

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can update task title
- User can update task description
- User selects task by ID
- System validates task ID exists
- System confirms update with success message
- Show "Task not found" error for invalid ID

### User Story 4: Delete Task
**As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove completed or cancelled items.**

Acceptance Criteria:
- User selects task by ID to delete
- System validates task ID exists
- System asks for confirmation before deletion
- System confirms deletion with success message
- Show "Task not found" error for invalid ID

### User Story 5: Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete
**As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress.**

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can toggle task status by ID
- Pending tasks can be marked as completed
- Completed tasks can be marked as pending (undo)
- System validates task ID exists
- System confirms status change with success message
- Status change is reflected immediately in task list

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Task Data Model
Each task must contain:
- id: integer (auto-generated, unique)
- title: string (required, 1-200 chars)
- description: string (optional, max 1000 chars)
- completed: boolean (default: false)
- created_at: timestamp (auto-generated)

### FR-2: In-Memory Storage
- All tasks stored in Python data structure (list/dict)
- Data persists only during program execution
- Data is lost when program exits

### FR-3: User Interface (CLI)
- Clear menu showing available commands
- Numbered options for each operation
- Input validation with helpful error messages
- Clean, formatted output for task display

### FR-4: Command Flow
[User input was truncated in original command args]

## Response snapshot

**Created comprehensive specification at**: `specs/001-todo-console-app/spec.md`

**Branch**: `001-todo-console-app` (newly created)

**5 User Stories Defined** (prioritized P1-P5):
1. **View All Tasks (P1)** - Foundation for all operations, enables users to see task IDs
2. **Add New Task (P2)** - Primary write operation, enables data entry
3. **Toggle Task Status (P3)** - Core progress tracking workflow
4. **Update Task (P4)** - Occasional edits to correct mistakes
5. **Delete Task (P5)** - Cleanup operation, least critical

Each user story includes:
- Plain language description
- Priority justification with business rationale
- Independent test description
- 5-7 detailed acceptance scenarios (35 total) in Given-When-Then format

**20 Functional Requirements** covering:
- Main menu structure (FR-001)
- Input validation and error handling (FR-002, FR-019, FR-020)
- Task ID management (FR-003, FR-011)
- Data validation (FR-004, FR-005, FR-017)
- Task data model (FR-006)
- Display formatting (FR-007, FR-008, FR-010)
- Operation confirmation (FR-009, FR-012, FR-014, FR-015)
- Status toggling (FR-013)
- Character preservation (FR-016)
- In-memory storage constraint (FR-018)

**8 Success Criteria** (measurable, technology-agnostic):
- 90-second full workflow demo (SC-001)
- 100% clear error messages (SC-002)
- 50+ operations without crash (SC-003)
- 5-second task comprehension (SC-004)
- First-attempt operation success (SC-005)
- Helpful empty-list guidance (SC-006)
- Deletion confirmation safety (SC-007)
- Data integrity throughout session (SC-008)

**Edge Cases**: 9 scenarios identified (empty list, boundaries, special chars, ID overflow, rapid ops, invalid menu, whitespace, case sensitivity, input interruption)

**Assumptions**: 10 informed decisions documented (data persistence, single user, display order, ID strategy, input method, character limits, status model, exit behavior, error recovery, confirmation scope)

**Out of Scope**: 17 Phase I exclusions clearly listed (persistence, categories, priorities, search, sort, undo, history, multi-user, auth, config, import/export, notifications, recurring, subtasks, batch ops, shortcuts, formatting, analytics)

**Quality Validation**: Created `specs/001-todo-console-app/checklists/requirements.md` - all quality gates passed:
- 笨 No implementation details
- 笨 Focused on user value
- 笨 Technology-agnostic
- 笨 All requirements testable and unambiguous
- 笨 Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- 笨 Ready for planning phase

## Outcome

- 笨 Impact: Complete, validated Phase I specification ready for implementation planning
- 洫ｪ Tests: Specification quality checklist passed (12/12 criteria)
- 沒 Files: Created spec.md (196 lines) and requirements.md checklist
- 沐 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation architecture and design
- 洫 Reflection: Specification successfully balances detail with technology-agnosticism. Prioritized user stories enable incremental delivery (P1竊単2竊単3竊単4竊単5). All acceptance criteria testable without implementation knowledge. Zero clarifications needed due to informed assumptions based on Phase I constraints and CLI conventions.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification creation successful on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All 12 quality checklist items passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): User should proceed with `/sp.plan` to design system architecture, data model, and file structure while maintaining alignment with constitutional constraints (Python 3.13+, in-memory, zero external deps, type hints, docstrings)
