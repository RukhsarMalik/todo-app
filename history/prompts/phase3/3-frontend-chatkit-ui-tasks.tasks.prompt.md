  Generated comprehensive task list for Frontend ChatKit UI feature (1-frontend-chatkit). The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing:

  Total tasks: 39
  - Setup phase: 3 tasks
  - Foundational phase: 7 tasks
  - User Story 1 (P1): 6 tasks - Chat Interface Access
  - User Story 2 (P1): 6 tasks - Send Natural Language Commands
  - User Story 3 (P2): 6 tasks - View Conversation History
  - User Story 4 (P2): 5 tasks - Navigate Between Features
  - Polish phase: 7 tasks

  Each user story is designed to be independently testable with clear dependencies. Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels where appropriate. Parallel execution opportunities are identified with [P] markers.

  The task list covers all aspects from initial setup and dependency installation to final polish and validation, following the MVP-first approach with incremental delivery strategy.
outcome: "SUCCESS: Task list generated and validated according to SDD standards"
evaluation: "The tasks follow the template structure, are organized by user story priority, include proper formatting with checkboxes and IDs, and have clear dependencies mapped. Ready for implementation phase."
