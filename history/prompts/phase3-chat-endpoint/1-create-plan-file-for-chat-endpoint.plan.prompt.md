# Create a plan file for D:/hackathon-2/specs/phase3/3-chat-endpoint

## PROMPT_TEXT

create a plan file for D:/hackathon-2/specs/phase3/3-chat-endpoint

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Phase III Chat Endpoint with OpenAI Agent. The plan includes:

1. Researched and documented OpenAI Agent SDK integration with MCP server tools
2. Defined data models for chat functionality (reusing existing Conversation/Message models)
3. Created API contracts for chat endpoints
4. Provided quickstart guide with implementation examples
5. Updated agent context with new technology stack information

All "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items were resolved through research, and the implementation follows constitutional requirements for stateless design, security, and persistence.
